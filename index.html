      <p>We are named for the coldest, most unforgiving side of a mountain. We have helped explorers reach the most unfathomable
        heights of the Himalayas. But The North Face® legend begins, ironically, on a beach. More precisely, San Francisco's
        North Beach neighborhood, at an altitude of only 150 feet above sea level. It was here in 1966 that two hiking enthusiasts
        resolved to follow their passions and founded a small mountaineering retail store. From the beginning, the brand
        committed to serving all those who desired to explore and to serving our natural wild lands by helping to conserve
        them. At our core, we believe exploration creates an indelible bond with the outdoors, inspiring people to protect
        our land and pass these beliefs down to the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>Soon thereafter, that little shop became known as The North Face, a retailer of high-performance climbing and backpacking
        equipment. In 1968, The North Face moved to the other side of San Francisco Bay, to the unbridled possibilities of
        the Berkeley area, and began designing and manufacturing its own brand of technical mountaineering apparel and equipment.

      </p>
      <p>By the early 1980s, The North Face was taking exploration to the outer limits of the ski world, adding extreme skiwear
        to the product offering. These were the days of pastels, neons, hair dye, and mohawks; they laid the groundwork for
        today's free-spirited snowsports athletes. By the end of the decade, The North Face became the only supplier in the
        United States to offer a comprehensive collection of high-performance outerwear, skiwear, sleeping bags, packs and
        tents.
      </p>
      <p>Now, more than 50 YEARS after its humble grand opening, The North Face delivers an extensive line of performance apparel,
        equipment, and footwear. We push the boundaries of innovation so that you can push the boundaries of exploration.
        We remain deeply proud to be the first choice of the world's most accomplished climbers, mountaineers, extreme skiers,
        snowboarders, endurance runners, and explorers.
      </p>
      <p>There's little telling what the next 50 years hold for us. However, there is one bedrock of certainty: The North Face
        will maintain an unwavering commitment to pushing the limits of innovation and design, so that you can push your
        limits outdoors. Never Stop Exploring.</p>
